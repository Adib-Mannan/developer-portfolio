            <h1>Dream Big</h1>
            <h2>Become a Hokage</h2>
            <p>Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a Ninja from Konohagakure(Leaf village ). He became the
                jinchūriki of the
                Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout
                his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all
                the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and
                ordeals, he became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of
                the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (木ノ葉隠れの英雄, Konohagakure no Eiyū, Literally
                meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves). He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the
                Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage
                (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, lit. Seventh Fire Shadow).</p>

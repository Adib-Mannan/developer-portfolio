                <h1>Dream Big</h1>
                <h2>Become a Hokage</h2>
                <p>Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a Ninja from Konohagakure(Leaf village ). He became the
                    jinchūriki of the
                    Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha
                    throughout
                    his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement
                    all
                    the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and
                    ordeals, he became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the
                    rest of
                    the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (木ノ葉隠れの英雄, Konohagakure no Eiyū, Literally
                    meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves). He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning
                    the
                    Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage
                    (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, lit. Seventh Fire Shadow).</p>

                </h2>
                <p>Obito Uchiha (うちはオビト, Uchiha Obito) was a member of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. He was believed to
                    have
                    died during the Third Shinobi World War, his only surviving legacy being the Sharingan he gave to
                    his
                    teammate, Kakashi Hatake. In truth, Obito was saved from death and trained by Madara Uchiha, but the
                    events of the war left Obito disillusioned with reality, and he inherited Madara's plan to create an
                    ideal world. Resurfacing under the names of Tobi (トビ, Tobi) and Madara Uchiha himself, Obito subtly
                    took
                    control of the Akatsuki, using them as a means to advance his machinations, eventually going public
                    and
                    starting the Fourth Shinobi World War. However, towards the war's conclusion, Obito had a change of
                    heart and, as atonement, sacrificed his life to save the same world he sought to replace.</p>

                <p>Nagato (長門, Nagato) Or Pain (ペイン, Pein) was a shinobi of Amegakure and descendant of the Uzumaki
                    clan.
                    Forming Akatsuki alongside his friends (and fellow war orphans) Yahiko and Konan, Nagato dreamed of
                    bringing peace to the violent shinobi world. However, following Yahiko's death, Nagato adopted the
                    alias
                    of Pain (ペイン, Pein) and, along with Konan, began leading a new Akatsuki — one that would force the
                    world
                    into peace using any means necessary.</p>
